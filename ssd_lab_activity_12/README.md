# SSD - Lab Activity 12 
## Pressure Sensing Mat

# Instructions

- The folder contains two files ```main.py``` and ```input.txt```.
- Both question1 and question2 is implemented in the ```main.py``` file only.
- For running question1,

    ```python3 main.py q1```
    
- For running question2,

    ```python3 main.py q2```
    
- The input file had uneven line breaks between two matrices. This leads to problems while reading the matrices. Hence, I've added only one line break between two successive matrices to maintain uniformity.
- The median value of time for the corresponding matrices has been taken as timestamp for them.
